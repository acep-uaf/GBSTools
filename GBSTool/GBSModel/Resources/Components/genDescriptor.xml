    <!-- 'maxDiesCapCharge' is the maximum capacity that charging the ESS can increase the diesel loading to. It
     depends on the state of charge of the ESS. It is defined by the tuple 'mdcc' which is the maximum diesel loading
     and the tuple 'e' which is the corresponding state of charge of the ESS. Units for 'mdcc' are P.U. of nameplate
     capacity of the diesel generator. Units for 'e' are P.U. of ESS nameplate energy capacity. Default values for
     'mdcc' are 0.65, 0.75, 0.85 and 0.9. The corresponding default values for 'soc' are 1, 0.3, 0.1 and 0. -->

    <!-- 'startCost' is the equivalent of the cost associated with starting the diesel generator in liters of diesel.
    This is used in the dispatch schedule to decide whether to switch or not. Default is 0. This should be updated to
    minimize diesel switching. This will be divied by the 'minRunTime' to get an L/hr value that will be added to the
     predicted fuel consumption of the diesel generators. -->
