<!-- This file describes an interface for all components that may be part of the model. It does not itself implement a -->

    <!-- Declaration of inheritance - the interface itself should be the master parent. Later more specific -->
    <!-- component descriptions should state the immediate parent here. All have to be traceable to this interface. -->
