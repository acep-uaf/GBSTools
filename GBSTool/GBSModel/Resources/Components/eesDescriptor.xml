    <!-- `isDCBus' describes if the particular storage system is packaged with a DC bus. Generally, this will be TRUE, -->
    <!-- but some kinetic energy storage systems may also have a fixed or variable AC bus. -->
    <isDCBus value="TRUE"/>

    <!-- 'buildingBlockVNom' describes the nominal voltage of a smallest practical building block of the unit. This is -->
    <!-- used instead of cell voltage as single cells will rarely make sense. Default value is 500 V. If this is AC or -->
    <!-- DC has to be ascertained from 'isDCBus' -->

    <!-- any power at all. Default is 500. Units are V. -->
    <buildingBlockVMinOp value="500" unit="V"/>
    <!-- `buildingBlockVMin' is the lowest voltage to which the unit can be discharged without destruction. This is -->
    <!-- relevant in the specification of potentially necessary precharge circuits in the inverter package. -->

    <!-- Dispatch Control parameters -->

    <!-- 'eesDispatchTime' is the minimum amount of time that the ESS must be able to supply the load for in order to

    <eesDispatchTime value="1800" unit="s"/>

    <!-- 'eesPinAvail_1_time' is used to find the maximum power that the EES can charge for 'eesPinAvail_1_time'

    <!-- In order to use the consider the equivalent fuel efficiency of dishcarging the ESS to allow running a smaller
     diesel generator, an equivalent fuel consumption of the ESS must be calculated in L/kWh. This is done by calculating
     how much diesel fuel went into charging the ESS to it'c current level. Divide the number of liters by the  state of
     charge to get the fuel consumption of using the energy storage. -->
    <!-- 'prevEesTime' is how far back that is used to assess what percentage of the current ESS charge came from
    the diesel generator. This is used in the dispatch schedule to determine the cost of discharging the ESS to supply
     the load for peak shaving or load leveling purposes. Units are seconds. Default is 86400 s (24 hr). -->
    <prevEesTime value="86400" unit="s"/>
    <!-- 'eesCost' is the cost of discharging the ESS that is above the fuel cost that went into charging it. It is
    stated as a fuel consumption per kWh, kg/kWh. It is added to the effective fuel consumption of discharging the
     ESS resulting from chargning it with the diesel generators. The cost is used to account for non-fuel costs of
     discharging the ESS including maintenance and lifetime costs. Units are kg/kWh. Default is 0. This should be updated
      to avoid overuse of the ESS. -->
