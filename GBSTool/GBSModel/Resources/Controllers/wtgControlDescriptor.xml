    <!-- 'maxDiesCapCharge' is the maximum capacity that charging the ESS can increase the diesel loading to. It
     depends on the state of charge of the ESS. It is defined by the tuple 'mdcc' which is the maximum diesel loading

     capacity of the diesel generator. Units for 'soc' are P.U. of ESS nameplate energy capacity. Default values for
     'mdcc' are 0.65, 0.75, 0.85 and 0.9. The corresponding default values for 'soc' are 1, 0.3, 0.1 and 0. -->
