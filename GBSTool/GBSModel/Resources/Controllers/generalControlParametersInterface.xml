    <!-- In order to decide between the which generating state should be chosen for the next step, the estimated fuel
      efficiency is calculated for each step. Fuel efficiency is defined as the total load divided by the total fuel
      consumption. -->
    <!-- 'prevLoadTime' is how far back the is used to assess previous load levels in order to predict future load
    levels. The assessment method is defined by parameter 'prevLoadAss'. the default is 5 min. -->
    <prevLoadTime value="5" unit="min"/>
    <!-- 'prevLoadAss' is the method used to assess the previous load in order to predict what the future load will be.
     'value' is a string. Options include 'average', 'weightedAverage' and 'trend' . Default is 'average'. This is just
     the average of the previous period described by 'prevLoadTime'.-->
    <prevLoadAss value="average" unit="NONE"/>

    <!-- Smoothing -->
    <!-- 'lowerCut' is the cut off frequency used in the FIR filter. Units: Hz. A value of zero indicates no smoothing
     This is used in conjunction with the number of taps specified in the control descriptions for each component.
      It has a default value of 0 Hz.  -->
    <lowerCut value="0" unit="Hz"/>
