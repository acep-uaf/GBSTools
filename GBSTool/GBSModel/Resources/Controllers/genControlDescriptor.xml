<!-- This file describes control parameters for a diesel generator. -->

    <!-- FIR filter parameters for smoothing the loading on diesel and wind units by the ESS -->
    <!-- 'ntaps' is the number of taps used to smooth the loading on the diesel generator. A value of 0 indicates
     no filtering. Default is 0. -->
    <ntaps value="0" unit="NONE"/>

    <!-- 'maxDiesCapCharge' is the maximum capacity that charging the ESS can increase the diesel loading to. It
     depends on the state of charge of the ESS. It is defined by the tuple 'mdcc' which is the maximum diesel loading
     and the tuple 'soc' which is the corresponding state of charge of the ESS. Units for 'mdcc' are P.U. of nameplate
     capacity of the diesel generator. Units for 'soc' are P.U. of ESS nameplate energy capacity. Default values for
     'mdcc' are 0.65, 0.75, 0.85 and 0.9. The corresponding default values for 'soc' are 1, 0.3, 0.1 and 0. -->

    <!-- 'MOL' describes the minimum optimal loading. Units are in P.U. of nameplate capacity. -->
    <!-- Default value is 0.4. There are no units. -->
    <MOL value="0.4" unit="PU"/>

    <!-- 'minRunTime' is the minimum amount of time that the diesel generator should run online for before being  -->
    <!-- brought offline. This will be followed except in situations which require the unit to be brought offline -->
    <!-- earlier to avoid critical situations. Units: seconds. Default is 3600 sec (1 Hr).  -->
    <minRunTime value="3600" unit="sec"/>

    <!-- 'startTime' is the ammount of time it takes a hot diesel generator to be brought online. This means cranking, -->
    <!-- synchronizing, connecting and ramping to full load capability. Units: seconds. Default is 30. -->
    <startTime value="30" unit="s"/>

    <!-- 'startCost' is the equivalent of the cost associated with starting the diesel generator in liters of diesel.
    This is used in the dispatch schedule to decide whether to switch or not. Default is 0. This should be updated to
    minimize diesel switching. This will be divied by the 'minRunTime' to get an L/hr value that will be added to the
     predicted fuel consumption of the diesel generators. -->
    <startCost value="0" unit="L"/>
