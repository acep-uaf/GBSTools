<!-- This file describes one set of ESS control parameters. -->

    <!-- Declaration of inheritance. Parent of this generic diesel generator descriptor should be the interface itself.  -->

    <!-- 'essSrcTime' is the minimum amount of time that the ess must be able to discharge for at the current level of
      SRC that it is supplying. Units are in seconds. Default is 120 s.  -->
    <essSrcTime value="2" unit="s"/>

    <!-- 'essdispatchTime' is the minimum amount of time that the ESS must be able to supply the load for in order to
    be considered as an active discharge option in the diesel schedule. Units are in hours. Default is 0.5.   -->
    <essdispatchTime value="0.5" unit="hr"/>

    <!-- In order to use the consider the equivalent fuel efficiency of dishcarging the ESS to allow running a smaller
     diesel generator, an equivalent fuel consumption of the ESS must be calculated in L/kWh. This is done by calculating
     how much diesel fuel went into charging the ESS to it'c current level. Divide the number of liters by the  state of
     charge to get the fuel consumption of using the energy storage. -->

    <!-- 'prevESSTime' is how far back that is used to assess what percentage of the current ESS charge came from
    the diesel generator. This is used in the dispatch schedule to determine the cost of discharging the ESS to supply
     the load for peak shaving or load leveling purposes. Units are hours. Default is 24 hr. -->
    <prevESSTime value="24" unit="hr"/>

    <!-- 'essCost' is the cost of discharging the ESS that is above the fuel cost that went into charging it. It is
    stated as a fuel consumption per kWh, L/kWh. It is added to the effective fuel consumption of discharging the
     ESS resulting from chargning it with the diesel generators. The cost is used to account for non-fuel costs of
     discharging the ESS including maintenance and lifetime costs. Units are L/kWh. Default is 0. This should be updated
      to avoid overuse of the ESS. -->
    <essCost value="0" unit="L/kWh"/>
