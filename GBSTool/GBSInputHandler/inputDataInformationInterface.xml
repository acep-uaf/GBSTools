      Then it will assume that the data files are organized in a data table with a header at the top. -->

    <!-- 'componentChannels' describes the input data channels corresponding to grid components to read into the simulation.
    The tuple 'headerName' is the names or indices of the columns in the input data files. The component names are the
    in the componentDescriptor files. -->
