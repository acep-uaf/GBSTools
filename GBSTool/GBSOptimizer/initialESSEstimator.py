# INITIAL ESS ESTIMATOR contains routines to preliminarily estimate the power and energy size range envelope in which to
# search for the most optimal solutions. For this, the physical limitations (maximum ramping capability, minimum start
# time) of the diesel generator fleet are used. The approach is quite brut force, but should yield a reduction in search
# range nonetheless.
