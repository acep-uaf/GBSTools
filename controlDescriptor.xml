    <!-- FIR filter parameters for smoothing the loading on diesel and wind units by the ESS -->
    <!-- 'ntapsDiesel' is the number of taps used to smooth the loading on the diesel generator. A value of 0 indicates
     no filtering. Default is 0. -->
    <ntapsDiesel value="0" unit="NONE"/>

    <!-- 'ntapsWind' is the number of taps used to smooth the loading on the wind turbines. A value of 0 indicates
     no filtering. Default is 0. -->
    <ntapsWind value="0" unit="NONE"/>

    <!-- 'lowerCut' is the cut off frequency used in the FIR filter. Units: Hz. It has a default value of 1 Hz.  -->
    <lowerCut value="1" unit="Hz"/>

    <!-- ess controls -->
    <!-- 'essSrcTime' is the minimum amount of time that the ess must be able to discharge for at the current level of
      SRC that it is supplying. Units are in seconds. Default is 120 s.  -->
    <essSrcTime value="2" unit="s"/>

    <!-- 'essdispatchTime' is the minimum amount of time that the ESS must be able to supply the load for in order to
    be considered as an active discharge option in the diesel schedule. Units are in hours. Default is 0.5.   -->
    <essdispatchTime value="0.5" unit="hr"/>

    <!-- 'maxDiesCapCharge' is the maximum capacity that charging the ESS can increase the diesel loading to. It
     depends on the state of charge of the ESS. It is defined by the tuple 'mdcc' which is the maximum diesel loading
     and the tuple 'soc' which is the corresponding state of charge of the ESS. Units for 'mdcc' are P.U. of nameplate
     capacity of the diesel generator. Units for 'soc' are P.U. of ESS nameplate energy capacity. Default values for
     'mdcc' are 0.65, 0.75, 0.85 and 0.9. The corresponding default values for 'soc' are 1, 0.3, 0.1 and 0. -->
