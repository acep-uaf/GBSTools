<!-- This file describes an interface for all components that may be part of the model. It does not itself implement a -->
<!-- specific component and thus should not directly be used as description for a component. -->
<!-- Root tag is 'project' -->

 <!-- Declaration of inheritance - the interface itself should be the master parent. Later more specific -->
 <!-- project descriptions should state the immediate parent here. All have to be traceable to this interface. -->

 <inputFileDir value="OptimizerTestHarness InputData TimeSeriesData RawData"/>
 <!-- 'inputFileType' is the file type of the input data files. Eg '.CSV'  -->
 <inputFileType value="CSV"/>
 <!-- 'inputFileFormat' is format that the input files are in. This includes formatting specific to certain data sources
      where a script has been specifically generated to deal with the data. For example 'AVEC'. If this is not specified
      Then it will assume that the data files are organized in a data table with a header at the top. -->
 <inputFileFormat value="AVEC"/>
 <!-- 'componentNames' is a tuple of the names of components in the grid. Acceptable names must start with corresponding
     names to the component descriptor files, including: 'Gen', 'Wtg', 'Inv', 'Tes', 'Ees' and 'ControlledLoad'. For example 'Gen1',
      'Gen2', 'Wtg1',... -->
 <componentNames value="gen1 gen2 gen3 wtg1 wtg2 wtg3 wtg4 tes1 ees0"/>
 <!-- 'componentChannels' describes the input data channels corresponding to grid components to read into the simulation.
    The tuple 'headerName' is the names or indices of the columns in the input data files. The component names are the names
    in the componentDescriptor files. 'componentAttribute' describes what was measured and what the units were. For example,
    real power and kW. Possible values for componentAttribute include 'P' (real power), 'Q' (reactive power), 'S' (apparent
    power), 'pf' (power factor), 'V' (voltage), 'I' (current), 'f' (frequency), 'Tamb' (ambient temperature), 'Tstorage'
    (internal temperature for thermal storatge), 'WS' (windspeed), 'IR' (solar irradiation), 'WF' (water flow), 'Pavail'
    (available real power), 'Qavail' (available reactive power), 'Savail' (available apparent power). Available units
     for power include 'W', 'kW', 'MW', 'var', 'kvar', 'Mvar', 'VA', 'kVA', 'MVA'. Available units for voltage includes
     'V' and 'kV'. Available units for current are 'A' and 'kA'. Available units for frequency is 'Hz'. Available units
     for temperature are 'C', 'F' and 'K'. Available units for speed are 'm/s', 'ft/s', 'km/hr' and 'mi/hr'. Available
     units for irradiation is 'W/m2'. Available units for flow include 'm3/s', 'L/s', 'cfm' and 'gal/min'  -->
